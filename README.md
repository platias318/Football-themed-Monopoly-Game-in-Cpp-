This project was developed during my second year of university as a Computer Science student. It entails a C++ game inspired by football, resembling a simplified version of the popoular game "Monopoly,"
coupled with a public library with graphics assets provided by my instructor. The entire project is coded in C++ and incorporates basic graphics sourced from the aforementioned library.
The final built of the game can be found [here](https://github.com/platias318/Football-themed-Monopoly-Game/blob/main/Monopoly.sln)
