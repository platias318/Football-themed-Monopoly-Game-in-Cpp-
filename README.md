This project was developed during my second year as a Computer Science student. It is a C++ game inspired by football and modeled after a simplified version of the popular board game Monopoly. The game utilizes a public graphics library provided by my instructor and showcases my understanding of object oriented programming principles. The entire project is written in C++ and features multiple complex, well-structured classes designed to demonstrate my proficiency in C++ development.

The final built of the game is [here](https://github.com/platias318/Football-themed-Monopoly-Game/blob/main/Monopoly.sln)
